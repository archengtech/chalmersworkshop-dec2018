# Chalmers Workshop December 2018

This is the central repository of information and data for the workshop conducted at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden in December 2018 with the theme *The Asymptotic Gridshell.* The result of the workshop was a 8 x 9 x 4 meter (b x w x h) large structure made of actively bent plywood laths:

We created this repo to share the work done in relation to the workshop. Our aim has been to organize the information in such way that, in theory, anyone with the required equipment and manpower would be able to rebuild the structure from scratch (sort of like a recipe). An alternative route is obviously to take inspiration from parts of the project and implement it in your own. Hack it, rebuild it, improve it or extend it - it's all up to you!
